PROGRAMMING PORTIONS:
    - Water level monitoring:
        * Must use the water level sensor from the kit
        * Threshold detection can use either an interrupt from the comparator or via a sample using the ADC.
            [NOTE: You may NOT use the ADC library to perform the sampling!!]
        * Code:
            #define POWER_PIN 7
            #define SIGNAL_PIN A5
            int value = 0; // variable to store the sensor value
            void setup() {
                Serial.begin(9600);
                pinMode (POWER_PIN, OUTPUT); // configure D7 pin as an OUTPUT
                digitalWrite (POWER_PIN, LOW); // turn the sensor OFF
            }
            void loop() {
                digitalWrite (POWER_PIN, HIGH); // turn the sensor ON
                delay(10); // wait 10 milliseconds
                value = analogRead (SIGNAL_PIN); // read the analog value from sensor
                digitalWrite (POWER_PIN, LOW); // turn the sensor OFF
                Serial.print("Sensor value: " );
                Serial.println (value);
                delay(1000);
            }

    - Vent Control:

            }
            void loop(){
                int chk = DHT.read11(DHT11_PIN);
                Serial.print("Temperature = ");
                Serial.println(DHT.temperature);
                Serial.print("Humidity = ");
                Serial.println(DHT.humidity);
